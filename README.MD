# Auto Scaling Azure VM(ScaleSets) in response to events

The developer at Mystique Unicorn are building their application using event-driven architectural pattern to process streaming data. In this application, they will have their physical stores, send a stream sales and inventory related events to a central location, where multiple downstream systems will consume these events. They are looking to scale their event consumers running in Azure VM Scale Sets when their Azure Storage queue length increases. 

They heard that Azure offers capabilities to build event-driven architectures using kubernetes, Can you show them how they can get started?

## üéØ Solutions

We can configure autoscaling to Azure VMSS<sup>[1]</sup> to increase or decrease the VMsin response to events. In this particular case, we can to scale based on Storage Message Queue Length. As of now[Q2-2023], the granularity supported by Azure is at Storage Account level and not at individual Storage Queue Level<sup>[2]</sup>. So, this means we will have to restrict the storage account to only one queue to make this work. Lets assume this is acceptable in a parallel universe and continue.

While building this solution, I have found anamolies that created challenges in implementing this solution. I have documented them in the [Anamolies](#-anamolies) section. 

## üìù Anamolies

  Before we go ahead and check out the anamolies, lets be clear that there few messages in the queue already. Infact, i have a producer constantnlly adding messages to the queue over a period of time. So any query to the queue length should return a non-zero value.

   - **Azure Monitor Portal** - My own testing shows that the metric is not updated even after every few hours

   - **Azure Monitor Storage Account Metrics** - The granularity of Storage Queue Metrics is at storage account level and not at individual resource level <sup>[3],[4],[5]</sup> as a metric. 
   - **Azure Monitor Metric Update Frequency** - `QueueMessageCount` is platform metric<sup>[5]</sup>. The update frequency is supposedly `1` minute<sup>[6]</sup>. 
   
        _Excerpt from the docs_<sup>[5]</sup>
    
        >This article is a complete list of all platform (that is, automatically collected) metrics currently available with the consolidated metric pipeline in Azure Monitor.

        _Excerpt from the docs_<sup>[6]</sup>
    
        >Platform metrics are collected from Azure resources at **one-minute** frequency unless specified otherwise in the metric's definition.

      The best practices for monitoring Azure Queue Storage<sup>[7]</sup> informs that this is metric is refreshed daily.

        _Excerpt from the docs_<sup>[7]</sup>
    
        >You can monitor the message count for all queues in a storage account by using the QueueMessageCount metric. This metric is **refreshed daily**.
   
   - **Azure SDK to Query Queue Metrics from Azure Monitor** - Querying the Queue Metrics directly using the SDK also does not reflect the facts. I used the python<sup>[8],[9]</sup> SDK and wrote a script to query the metrics. The metric is not updated even after every few hours.

      ```python
      # export PYTHONWARNINGS="ignore:Unverified HTTPS request"
      # pip install azure-mgmt-monitor==6.0.0
      # pip install azure-monitor-query=1.1.1
      import os
      from datetime import timedelta, datetime
      from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
      from azure.mgmt.monitor import MonitorManagementClient
      from azure.monitor.query import LogsQueryClient, MetricsQueryClient, MetricsQueryClient, MetricAggregationType


      subscription_id = "1axxxx9e3"
      resource_group = "Miztiik_Enterprises_scale_vmss_on_events_011"
      storage_account = "warehouseghv6kv011"
      queue_service = "store-events-q-011"

      metrics_uri = (
          f"subscriptions/{subscription_id}"
          f"/resourceGroups/{resource_group}"
          f"/providers/Microsoft.Storage"
          f"/storageAccounts/{storage_account}"
          f"/queueServices/{queue_service}"
      )

      credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

      query_client = MetricsQueryClient(credential)
      start_time = datetime(2023, 4, 19)
      duration = timedelta(days=2)


      response = query_client.query_resource(
          metrics_uri,
          metric_names=["QueueMessageCount"],
          timespan=(start_time, duration)
          )
      
      print(f"QueueMessageCount: {response.metrics._metric_names['QueueMessageCount']} TimePeriod: {response.timespan} Granularity: {response.granularity} ")
      ```
      _Output_

      ```bash
      QueueMessageCount: 0 TimePeriod: 2023-04-19T00:00:00Z/2023-04-21T00:00:00Z Granularity: 1:00:00
      ```

      StackOverflow<sup>[11]</sup> has highlighted the issue. 
  

   - **Azure SDK to Query Queue Metrics from Azure Monitor** - Querying the Queue Message count directly using SDK seems to deliver much better results. Using the Python SDK<sup>[10]</sup>, I have tested the queue length update frequency.

      ```python
      import os
      import time
      from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
      from azure.storage.queue import QueueServiceClient

      Q_NAME="store-events-q-011"
      SA_NAME = os.getenv("SA_NAME", "warehouseghv6kv011")
      Q_SVC_ACCOUNT_URL=f"https://{SA_NAME}.queue.core.windows.net"

      credential = DefaultAzureCredential(logging_enable=False)
      q_svc_client = QueueServiceClient(Q_SVC_ACCOUNT_URL, credential=credential)

      q_client = q_svc_client.get_queue_client(Q_NAME)

      for num in range(1, 11):
          properties = q_client.get_queue_properties()
          count = properties.approximate_message_count
          print("Current Message count: " + str(count))
          time.sleep(10)
      ```
      _Output: As we can observe the # of messages keep increasing every `10` seconds_
      ```bash
      Tuple timeout setting is deprecated
      Current Message count: 2973

      ```

   - **Azure Portal - Strange Place to look for consistencies** - If you navigate to the Azure Storage Queue Resource Portal Page, Surprisingly you will find the queue length being updated in the properties field.

## üìí Conclusion

    From this, I have come to the conclusion that the `QueueMessageCount` metric is not updated frequently by the platform. The best way to monitor the queue length is to use the SDK to query the queue directly. We can use Functions to query the queue length and scale the VMSS accordingly.

  ```bash

## üßπ CleanUp

If you want to destroy all the resources created by the stack, Execute the below command to delete the stack, or _you can delete the stack from console as well_

- Resources created during this demo
- _Any other custom resources, you have created for this demo_

```bash
# Delete from resource group
az group delete --name Miztiik_Enterprises_xxx --yes
# Follow any on-screen prompt
```

This is not an exhaustive list, please carry out other necessary steps as maybe applicable to your needs.
